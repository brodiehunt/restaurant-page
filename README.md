## Academic Goals
From an Academic standpoint, each project I build is used as a vehicle to learn. In this project, 
it was the first time I have encorporated webpack, and implemeneted javascript modules. This was my main academic goal.
It was also the first time I have used Figma to design high fidelity wireframes, they are shown below.
